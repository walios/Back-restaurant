# Restaurant Reservation System

This project is a restaurant reservation system that enables users to book a table in their desired restaurant. The system provides features like path tracing, geolocation, user authentication, booking process, and restaurant registration.


## Features

- Path Tracing
The system is capable of tracing the path that takes the user to their desired restaurant. This can be done through geolocation, visual interactive maps, statistical algorithms, and machine learning algorithms.
- User Authentication
The system provides identity verification for all visitors who want to book a table. Users can sign up for the system by providing their email address and password. If the user is not already registered, they can sign up for the system.
- Booking Process
The system offers multiple options for users to create a reservation. They can book a table for a specific time and date, select the number of guests, and make special requests if needed.
- Restaurant Registration
The system allows restaurant owners to register their restaurant by providing information such as location, menu, pictures, and opening hours.
- Management
The system provides management of services, plans, and offers. It also manages user information and addresses, and offers a customer interface for restaurant owners and customers.
- Centralized Management
The system offers centralized management for authentication and authorizations of users of different modules. Lists with geolocation can be imported via web service API or JSON files.
